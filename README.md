## **LIBFT - a project about coding a C library**

Libft contains recoded versions of many functions of the C standard library 
as well as a set of useful functions that are either not in the libc,
or that are part of it in a different form.

The Libft in it's current version has been extended with\
**ft_printf()** - a simplified version of printf, and **get_next_line()** - a similar function to readline().

### Learning objectives:
- Understanding the implementation (and limitations) of standard C functions
- Getting into practice of reading documentation
- Extensive use of pointers and char arrays
- Recognizing and anticipating edge cases
- Imperative programming
- Rigor
- Unix
