LIBFT is a project about coding a C library.

It contains versions of many standard C functions as well as well as a set of functions that are either not in the libc,
or that are part of it but in a different form.
The Libft in it's current version has been extended with 
-ft_printf - a simplified version of printf, and 
-get_next_line() - a similar function to readline()
